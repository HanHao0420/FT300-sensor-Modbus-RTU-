# FT300-sensor-Modbus-RTU-
This is a Windows Form Project created in Visual Studio C# which can be used to reach the data of FT300 Sensor

In this project, there will be two kinds of demonstration on how to reach the data of FT300 sensor ROBOTIQ. 
Including utilizing EasyModbus library to Read Holding Registers of sensor and reaching the data without any library.

There're some other website can be visited:

Example:
